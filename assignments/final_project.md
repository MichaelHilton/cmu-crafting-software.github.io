# Final Project
This page contains the deadlines and important deliverables for the Final Project. Please read the entire page in full. 

# Deliverables
- The primary deliverable for each stage of the project is the application you are building. Focus on working code and writing tests over presentation quality.
- All of your code should be pushed to your team's GitHub repository as frequently as possible and certainly before each check-in and the final deadline. 
- On April 29 and May 6 there will be check-in demonstrations in which each team will give a ~5 minute demonstration of their application to the class. Do not prepare 
slides for these check-in demonstrations. Instead, show off how users can use your application or show your code. 
- In the final exam slot assigned to the class, each team will give a longer demonstration and presentation about your project. Your presentation should explain the goals
of the project, how far you got toward achieving those goals, what challenges you faced, and what you would do next if you had more time. You should also demonstration your 
application and show off interesting bits of your code. You can prepare slides if you like for the final demonstration, but it is not required.
