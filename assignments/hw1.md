# Homework 1
In this homework you will practice using Version Control Systems, git and GitHub. Please read the entire assignment in full before you begin. You might find some helpful information in the Resources section.

## Learning goals
- Understand basic concepts of Version Control Systems (VCS)
- Create Github Account
- Performing basic VCS actions
- Understand difference between git and GitHub
- Practice VCS commands necesary for turning in homeworks

## Tasks
In this homework, you will be practicing using version control (git and GitHub).  We will be using this throught the course extensivly.  
You will be asked to perform the following series of tasks:
- Create a GitHub account
- Clone HW1 repo
- Create a branch locally
- Push branch to github
- Make a change to the student list, and commit locally, managing any conflicts that might exist
- Open a Pull request to the main branch

#### Create a Github account
You should create a free [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account if you do not already have one.  
If you have an existing GitHub account, you may use that.

#### Clone HW1 repo
There is a very simple repo that has been setup for HW1. You can find it [here](https://github.com/cmu-crafting-software/Homework01).  You should clone the repo to a local directory on your machine.   
#### Create a branch locally
You should create a new branch of the repository, and you should name the branch with your andrewID as the name.

#### Make a change to the student list, and commit locally, managing any conflicts that might exist
In the branch that you can created, you should make a change to the ClassRoster.md file, adding your name and andrewID to the Class Roster.  You should then commit that change to your local branch. 

#### Push branch to github
Once you have committed your change, you should push the change on the branch to the GitHub repository.  Please ensure you use a descriptive commit message! 

#### Open a Pull request to the main branch
Now that the commit is visible on the GitHub site, you should open a Pull Request from your personal branch, to the main branch.  Again, don't forget to have a descriptive message for the Pull Request.

## Tips and Suggestions
We strongly encourage you learn to use the command line interface.  While there are several git clients ([SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/,[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))) out there, we suggest you learn how to complete the actions via command line.  If you are uncomfortable with that, you might want to try using a client first, then re-doing the assignment with the command line. 

Writing a good commit message is hard! don't feel bad if it takes a bit of thinking, or if you are not happy with your first version.

One pro tip with git.  It can often be the case that your local directory can get really messed up. Feel free to delete your local directly and start over.  This is a common technique when working with git.
