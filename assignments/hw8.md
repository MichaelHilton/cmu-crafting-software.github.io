# Homework 8
This homework has two unrelated parts:
- Revision of project proposal with team 
- Visualization reading 

The parts are described in detail below.

## Revision of project proposal with team 
Write a revised project proposal. Your revised proposal should list all of the members of your team. The proposal can be based on the proposal one of the teamates submitted, can merge ideas from two proposals, or propose something entirely new. We strongly suggest you work with 1 or 2 others, but it is also acceptable to work alone. The revised proposal should meet all of the requirements described in HW6:
> Your proposal should include a short project title and 2-3 paragraphs describing the purpose and scope of the project. Your writeup should address the following questions:
>    * What is the audience for your project? Who might use it if you succeed? For what purpose?
>   * What are the set of features in your minimum-viable product?
>   * What other features will you include?
>   * How will you implement each feature? Which technologies will you use?

Please consider carefully each technology and feature choice. Motivate why the particular technology choice is appropriate.

## Visualization reading 

In class on Tuesday we will be discussion data visualization. In particular, we will be working with the [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) "grammar of interactive graphics." To understand that tool, it is helpful to have a general understanding of types of charts that are commonly used and their varieties. Please read [A Tour through the Visualization Zoo](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1805128) before class on Tuesday. Be prepared to discuss the chart types discussed in the paper, the types of charts you've used before, and which types you might use in your final project. 

## Deadline

This homework is due before class (4pm EDT) on Tuesday, April 6.
