Create a Github account . You should create a free GitHub account if you do not already have one. If you are creating a new github account, you might want to consider using your andrewID, as that will make things easier for us. But you may use any account name you want. If you have an existing GitHub account, you may use that. Clone HW1 repo . There is a very simple repo that has been setup for HW1. You can find it here. You should clone the repo to a local directory on your machine. This should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in. Create a branch locally . You should create a new branch of the repository, and you should name the branch with your andrewID as the name. This should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in. Make a change to the student list, and commit locally, managing any conflicts that might exist . In the branch that you created, you should make a change to the ClassRoster.md file, adding your name and andrewID to the Class Roster. You should then commit that change to your local branch. Commiting should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in. Push branch to github . Once you have committed your change, you should push the change on the branch to the GitHub repository. Please ensure you use a descriptive commit message! This should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in. Open a Pull request to the main branch . Now that the commit is visible on the GitHub site, you should open a Pull Request from your personal branch, to the main branch. Again, don’t forget to have a descriptive message for the Pull Request. You do not need to do this via the command line, you may use the GitHub website for opening the pull request. Manage merge conflicts . Merge conflicts can be very annoying, and will be a cause of headaches for you. We want you to try and follow these steps to (artificially) create a merge conflict, so that you can merge the conflict. Here are the steps to follow: . | In the branch &lt; andrewID &gt;, create a text file called “student_facts.txt” | In this file, write what year and college you are in | Commit this change and include a message about what you just did | Create a new branch called &lt; new_andrewID &gt; and switch to that branch | Open up “student_facts.txt” and delete the previous line you wrote and now only include a sentence about a fun fact about yourself | Commit this change and include a message about what you just did | Switch back to the branch &lt; andrewID &gt; | Open up “student_facts.txt” and append to this file a sentence about what programming languages and/or coding classes you have taken | Commit this change and include a message about what you just did | While in &lt; andrewID &gt;, merge this branch with &lt; new_andrewID &gt; | You will see that there are conflicts | To resolve these conflicts, open on the file “student_facts.txt” and edit the file such that there are three different lines with (and in this order): . | A sentence about your year and major | A sentence about what programming languages and/or coding classes you have taken | A sentence with a fun fact about yourself | Commit this change and include a message about what you just did | . | While in &lt; andrewID &gt;, create a file with all of the Terminal commands you used so far The appropriate steps here should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in. | .

Clone Homework Repo via GitHub Classroom. Your first step for this project is to configure your repository that you will be working in for this assignment. You should create a repository via Github classroom at this link: https://classroom.github.com/a/yFf56mVO You will be committing your solutions to this repo for all this homework. Create and run a “Hello World” program . In recitation you will be performing this task. You may simply copy your recitation solution for this. You should commit your solution as a single commit to your Homework Repository. Read csv file of COVID data . You should write a small program in python that will read data from a .csv file. In this class, we will be using the .csv file of data from the COVID tracking project (https://covidtracking.com/). You can find the CSV file here: https://covidtracking.com/data/download We suggest you work with the national summary data. You should download the csv file and commit it to your homework repository. Then, you should write a small program to read each line of the CSV file into your program. You should push a commit to your repository with a clear name once you have reached this point. Print COVID Data . The next step is to simply print out the data using the “print” function in your application. Once you have achieved this, you should commit this change to your repository, and push it to your repo. Calculate the sum and average of any two columns in the data set . The data in the .csv is documented by the first row in the dataset. You should choose one of the columns with numerical values, and calculate the sum of all the numbers. Then, you should calculate the average of another numerical column. To confirm these are the correct values, you should import the csv into a spreadsheet (excel, google sheets, etc), and calculate the same values, and compare them. You should then commit this code. In the commit message, you should specify which columns you used, and what the values were. Read data directly from the covid data tracking project using their API, using requests API . Another way to get the data from the covid tracking project is to use their API (Application Programming Interface). You can find the API documented here: https://covidtracking.com/data/api To get the data from the API, you will need to make a request. To make the API call, you should use the requests API: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/ NOTE: installing requests might go smoothly, or it might be difficult. Please don’t hesitate to reach out, as there are lots of small things that could make this step go wrong. To confirm that you have retrieved the data, you should print it out. Then, you should commit and push this to your homework repository . Show correctness by calculating a value available on the website, to confirm correctness . To verify that you are using the data correctly, you should find a value on the website that you can calculate from the API data. You should then calculate the value, and compare it against the value on the site. Your commit message should show what the value is, and what confirm what your calculated value is. ",

Pull Changes from your repository . We have pushed the starter code and input data to each for your repositories, specifically to a folder titled HW3 in your homework-username directory. Confirm that you can run the starter code . You should start by confirming that you can run the starte code we provided for you in your repositories. It is called ‘cleanCSV.py’. When you run it, it should read the input csv file (‘input.csv’) and write an output csv file (‘output.csv’). The starter code should perform all the file reading and writing. When you first run it the output file will be the same as the input file. Identify problems in the uncleaned csv file . You should identify the problem we have injected into the uncleaned csv file. We have added two examples of nine types of problems to the file (a total of 18 problems). You should identify them all. Since the file is large you will be most effective in finding the problems if you search for them programmatically. You might also want to write asserts to help identify problems. To assist you, we have provided a file, problems.md, which gives a short description of each type of problem. Once you find the problems, you should write their line numbers under the appropriate category in problems.md. mitigate issues computationally . Modify starter code file so it outputs a cleaned csv. You should not repair the mangled .csv by hand. Your program should output as much of the original data as possible, but repair the problems you identified in one of the ways we discussed in class: 1) replace garbled data with default values 2) use an average of other values in the column 3) remove extraneous content 4) adds missing content 5) perform a bespoke/one-off correction. If the input data is irredeemable it is also okay to remove the line. For each of the problems you identified above, write a very short (e.g. one sentence) justification of the fix to your program. These justifications should explain why the fix you wrote was appropriate for the problem. Write these justifications immediately after each problem in problems.md. ",

Retrieve COVID vaccination and state population data . | Use Python to retrieve the 2019 Census estimated population of each state for each of the following age groups: Age 85 years and older, Age 80 to 84 years, Age 75 to 79 years, Age 70 to 74 years, Age 65 to 69 years, Age 60 to 64 years, Age 55 to 59 years, Age 50 to 54 years, Age 45 to 49 years, Age 40 to 44 years, Age 35 to 39 years, Age 30 to 34 years, Age 25 to 29 years, Age 20 to 24 years, Age 15 to 19 years, Age 10 to 14 years, Age 5 to 9 years, Age 0 to 4 years. Use the Census “charagegroups” API. Refer back to the in-class from February 12 for examples of use. | Use Python to retrieve the COVID testing data for every state from each day using The Covid Tracking Project. It’s probably easiest to load the data from a file, but you can also use the API if you prefer. You will ultimately store this data in the database. For now, read from the APIs and files and assign the result to Python variables. | . 2. Create database tables . | Design a reasonable table layout for the data retrieved in the previous step. Use at least two tables and choose reasonable relationships between tables. Every table should have a primary key. Use foreign key(s) to preserve referential integrity. | Write SQL data definition language (DDL) code to create the tables you designed. Be sure to choose reasonable datatypes for each column and use primary and foreign keys where appropriate. | At the minimum your tables should include the following columns across all the tables. You can discard other data from step 1 or add additional columns: state_code, state_name, age_group_id, age_group_description, population, test_date, negative_increase, positive_increase, total_test_results_increase. | Save your SQL DDL code in a file called createTables.sql. | Create the tables in your database using the SQL DDL code you wrote. | . 3. Insert the retrieved data into tables . | Use Python to insert all of the data retrieved in step 1 above into the database defined in Step 2. | . 4. Query the database . Use Python to query the database and print out answers to the following below. Feel free to use any combination of SQL queries and Python code to answer the question. | Which state has the lowest percentage of people aged 85 years and older? Print the name of the state, the percentage, to 85+ population, and the total population. | Which state had the most positive tests per capita in a single day? Print the name of state, the day, the number of positive tests per capita, the population of the state, and the number of positive tests. | The Python code you wrote in this step, step 1, and step 3 should be save in a file called readAndInsert.py. | .

Create a view in your table . You should create a view of a query. Your view should show the population for each state for all ages, and all ages only. You should name your view something that makes it clear that it is all ages population. You should perform these commands via a python script. You can start with your answer to hw4, and add the creation of a view. HINT: the “ OR REPLACE” keyword might come in handy to be able to re-run your script multiple times. Create a transaction to make at least two changes do the DB in a single transaction . You should create a transaction in your database. Your transaction should alter at least two rows in the transaction. You may choose which two rows to alter. You should print out the values of the rows first, then perform the transaction, then print the new values. This should also be done in your python script. Create random data to test our database . In order to be able to test an index, we will need more data. To do this, you should create a new table, and fill it with random data. This can be done with the following SQL commands. CREATE TABLE rand_state_data( rand_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, rand_state_code numeric NOT NULL, rand_value NUMERIC NOT NULL ); . INSERT INTO rand_state_data (rand_state_code,rand_value) SELECT ((random() * 49)+1)::integer, ((random() * 99) + 1)::integer FROM generate_series(1, 10000000); . NOTE: this only needs to be done one time, and it might take a while to run on your computer. You can do this directly from SQL, you do not need to do this from python. Join existing data with random data . You should count the number of random values that are greater than 80 for each state in your census data table. Your number will be slightly different than other students in the class. This should be done via a single SQL statement. You should join both tables, and count the number with a rand_value greater than 80. This query might take a while to run. You should run this query via your python script. Add an index to your table and measure a change in performance . We will speed up this query using at least one index. You should first run the query you created in the step above without the index created. You should observe and record the exact timing of the run with the “EXPLAIN ANALYZE” feature. Then, you should create at least one index that you think will speed it up. Then you should re-run the query with EXPLAIN ANALYZE with the index, and record what the speed up was. You should try adding a second index, and observe if there is a performance gain. You should copy the output of your script, including the recorded exectution times before and after the index, and commit them to your repo in a text file called SQLResults.txt. HINT: You might need to delete the index if you want to try doing this several times. ",

Ideally you will work with one partner, but it is also acceptable to work alone. Everyone should write a project proposal, but there will be a matchmaking phase later where you can join another project or merge your project with another student’s project. Defining and implementing the project will be an iterative process which will include many rounds of feedback and conversation with the course staff. The goal of the proposal is to start those conversations. Project templates . We are flexible about the project you propose, as long as it makes use of the skills you have learned in the class. You may find it helpful to consider one of the following project templates to help you develop your proposal: . | Start a new data analysis project for your research and develop it to the point that it is shareable. One good output could be a companion website for a research paper. | Take a coding project you’ve completed and turn it into a shareable application that others can use on similar data. | Develop a support utility for your lab, research group, or department. | . Deadlines and deliverables . Your proposal should include a short project title and 2-3 paragraphs describing the purpose and scope of the project. The proposal is due on Thursday March 25 at 4pm EDT. Your writeup should address the following questions: . | What is the audience for your project? Who might use it if you succeed? For what purpose? | What are the set of features in your minimum-viable product? | What other features will you include? | How will you implement each feature? Which technologies will you use? | . ",

Import data into a dataframe from your SQL Database . You should import the COVID data and the Census data from your database. You may reuse code from the previous homework, if you find that helpful. You should import each dataset into a dataframe each, and you will use these dataframes for the rest of the homework. Add a column to the covid data that indicates what day of the week each day represents . You should add a new column to the covid dataframe that represents the day of the week. You can use strings or numbers to represent the day of the week. (its ok if you want to do both a number and a string). Find the average number of increase in test results by day of the week (i.e., the avg number of test results increase on mondays, tuesdays, etc).

We will talk about visualizations in depth later on, but for now, you may plot the data if you want, but you are not required to. Join data frames . Join both dataframes, the covid and the census data. You should join them on states, as we have done previously. You should also create new dataframe that you can use for the following question. Add a new column to the data frame that is the per capita hospitalized number (hospitalizedCurrently/ total number of residents). Add a new column to the combined dataframe that is per capita hospitalizations. Avoid hidden state errors . Throughout this homework, you should follow best practices as we described in lecture. Specifically, you should avoid relying on hidden state. This means that you should be able to run your cells in any order, and get the same results. You should not have any 2 cells that write to the same object in shared state, but you may read the same object several times. ",

This course aims to provide students with sufficient knowledge and skills to use programming as part of their work. In this class, you will learn how to identify and find problems in your code. You will learn to read, parse, organize, and transform data. We will teach you to write code collaboratively and refine your programs so others can use them.The course will be a mixture of lecture and guided exercise with a recitation focused on hands on instruction. In this course, students are expected to have been exposed to some basic programming concepts, such as variables, if-statements, loops, and arrays. However, students are not expected to have extensive programming experience. This course is not appropriate for students that have completed more than two courses involving programming. We expect students in this class to have diverse backgrounds and experience. Some students will be self-taught, while others will have taken a programming course such as 02-201, 15-110, 95-898, or the library’s Software Carpentry workshop. Learning Goals . | Identify the common resources available for developing software and evaluate the quality of the content. | Understand important rules and conventions of software systems. | Understand and apply common languages and tools used to develop real-world software. | Apply collaborative work strategies when developing software. | Analyze alternative software tools and select appropriate choices for the problem. | Analyze software to diagnose problems and create solutions. | Create and deploy a web application that reads, parses, and analyzes data. | . Structure of the course . Meets twice weekly Most classes will include both a lecture and a collaborative in-class exercise There will be weekly homework assignments for students to practice that week’s material There will be a summative final project, in which students will integrate the tools and techniques they have learned into a cohesive whole. Evaluation in the course will be approximately as follows: . | Homeworks: 50% | Quizzes: 10% | Final project: 30% | Participation: 10% | . ",

    "title": "Professionalism.",
    "content": "Your classmates are your colleagues. This is particularly true in this course, where we aim to provide you with principles, practices, tools, and paradigms that will enable you to be an effective, real-world Software Engineer. We ask that you treat one another like the professionals you are and that you are preparing to be. To that end, we will not tolerate harassment in this class. We define harassment as unwelcome or hostile behavior of an ad hominem nature, i.e., that focuses not on ideas but on people and identity. This includes offensive verbal or written comments in reference to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of class meetings, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment is against the law and we have no tolerance for it, and neither does the university. Even when behavior does not rise to the level of harassment (even if you think you’re “just joking!”), it can still make people very uncomfortable, and harm their educational and professional career by forcing them to devote mental energy to something other than the material they are trying to learn or the professional successes they are trying to achieve. However, we expect that we do not need to threaten you to earn your respect on this matter: we simply ask that you treat one another like professionals, in the most positive sense. This has two implications: If you feel someone is violating these principles (for example, with a joke that could be interpreted as sexist, racist, or exclusionary), and you feel you have the standing to do so, speak up! Do not be a bystander to unprofessional behavior. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, and/or if the behavior persists, send a private email to the course instructors or set up a meeting with us to discuss the matter. We will preserve your anonymity. We, the course staff, are committed to affording you the same respect we ask you to afford one another. If you feel that we are not doing so, we hope you will feel comfortable either telling us so directly, or approaching another one of the course staff with your concerns. (Thank you to Shriram Krishnamurthi and Evan Peck for sharing their own policies, from which we drew inspiration for this one.) . ",

    "title": "Academic honesty and collaboration.",
    "content": "The usual policies apply, especially the University Policy on Academic Integrity. Many of the assignments will be done in groups. We expect that group members collaborate with one another, but that groups work independently from one another, not exchanging results with other groups. Within groups, we expect that you are honest about your contribution to the group’s work. This implies not taking credit for others’ work and not covering for team members that have not contributed to the team. Otherwise, our expectations regarding academic honestly and collaboration for group work are the same as for individual work, substituting elevated to the level of “group.” The course includes both individual assignments and individual components of group assignments. Although your solutions for individual parts will be based on the content produced for the group component (e.g., written reflections on lessons learned), we treat individual components of group assignments as equivalent to individual assignments overall, and expect you to complete such components independently of your groupmates. You may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was written by another student, or was developed together with another student, or was copied from another unauthorized source such as the Internet. You may not look at another student’s solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may you knowingly give your solution to another student or leave your solution where another student can see it. Here are some examples of behavior that are inappropriate: Copying or retyping, or referring to, files or parts of files (such as source code, written text, or unit tests) from another person or source (whether in final or draft form, regardless of the permissions set on the associated files) while producing your own. This is true even if your version includes minor modifications such as style or variable name changes or minor logic modifications. Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do not acknowledge on your solution. Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources. Lying to course staff. Giving copies of work to others, or allowing someone else to copy or refer to your code or written assignment to produce their own, either in draft or final form. This includes making your work publicly available in a way that other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others’ access is accidental or incidental to your goals. Beware the privacy settings on your open source accounts! Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help. If any of your work contains any statement that was not written by you, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Using existing material without proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question about whether the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the assignments, lectures, lecture notes; to give help or receive help in using the computer systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other facilities; or to discuss ideas at a very high level, without referring to or producing code. Any violation of this policy is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating (including plagiarism) will be a zero grade for the whole assignment. Cheating incidents will also be reported through University channels, with possible additional disciplinary action (see the above-linked University Policy on Academic Integrity). If you have any question about how this policy applies in a particular situation, ask the instructors for clarification. Note that the instructors respect honesty in these (and indeed most!) situations. ",
